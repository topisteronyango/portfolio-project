Our portfolio is an E-Commerce App for ordering food from the food vendors on ALU Rwanda campus and it will keep track of the customerâ€™s order.
Students and the staff are able to order a particular meal from any of the vendors and go for the order when ready. This will help reduce long queue at the food court and save time.
